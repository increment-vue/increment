        A Logbook System works as a daily record for business transactions. It
        is applicable to all businesses most especially with logistics,
        manufacturing, healthcare, hotels, schools, and many more. One of the
        things that most businesses aim, is the elimination of a manual system.
        Technically, there is no harm in applying a manual logbook system, since
        start-up companies always begin with that. Nowadays, a lot of industries
        are slowly shifting to software innovation; aiming for minimal resource
        consumption, such as hiring people to man for logbook monitoring, and
        thinking, why not handle it in one sitting, with just having a
        centralized software where you can manage all the monitoring at once.
