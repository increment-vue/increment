        An online booking system is a software that allows a potential customer
        to book and pay for an activity or service directly through a website.
        That means from the moment a customer decides on the booking date,
        preferred time, and pays for the booking, everything will be handled
        online. An efficient way to reduce workload, manpower, and the risk of
        double bookings.
