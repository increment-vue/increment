        One of the ways to help people understand other countries with different
        languages is to understand their dialect first. A translation software
        helps people understand in depth of what other people are trying to
        communicate. It not just helps the community but could focus on molding
        a childâ€™s knowledge towards understanding a language. This can be
        applied in schools for teaching the mother tongue based multilingual
        education.

        Increment Technologies is not new to this kind of software, we have
        built Talk Fluent Spanish, a spanish learning system that allows users
        to understand, pronounce, and memorize Spanish the easiest way possible.
        Knowing that not all people are Polyglot, a person who knows several
        languages, a translation learning system is a guide for the person to
        learn and understand the meaning of a dialect.
