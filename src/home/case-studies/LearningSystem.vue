        A learning system is an essential platform for a school to provide for
        its students. Amidst the pandemic, students must continue to learn and
        keep building their knowledge even through online platforms. Giving
        opportunities to students, learning without being physically present in
        school and still enjoying a high-quality education they deserve.
