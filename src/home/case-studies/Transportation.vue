        What can a Software Development Company do with transportation? It can
        develop a high-quality fleet management system that could store
        information for public transportation, RFID system, and more. A fleet
        management system allows businesses to effectively organize and
        coordinate work vehicles to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and
        provide compliance with governmentâ€™s standards and regulations.
